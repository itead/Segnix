ITEAD-SDK Python API
====================

ITEAD-SDK Python API is Python Application Program Interface of ITEAD-SDK.
It provides Python functions, variables and classes for Python users. All
functions, variables and classes in it , amazingly, have the same name as those
in ITEAD-SDK API. Python's syntax is more simple than C/C++. Besides, the ways
of invoking functions and accessing class members(include methods and datas) in
Python is almost the same as those in C/C++. The strategies and thoughts of
developing with Python have no much differences between two.

All of the above, we provide no documents for ITEAD-SDK Python API at present.
Python users can simply regard ITEAD-SDK API as ITEAD-SDK Python API when
programing.

Type Mapping
============

        C/C++                           Python

    int*_t                              int/long
    uint*_t                             int/long
    [signed|unsigned] char              int/long
    [signed|unsigned] short int         int/long
    [signed|unsigned] int               int/long
    [signed|unsigned] long int          int/long
    [signed|unsigned] long long         int/long
    float                               float
    double                              float
    char *                              str
    string                              str

Difference
==========

Functions unimplemented in ITEAD-SDK Python API:

    set8BitsBUS
    set16BitsBUS
    digitalWrite8 
    digitalWrite16 
    digitalRead8 
    digitalRead16 

In attachInterrupt function, the trigger methods below do not supported in 
ITEAD-SDK Python API:

    GPIO_EINT_CFG_HIGH
