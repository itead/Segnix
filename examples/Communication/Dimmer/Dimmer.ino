  Dimmer
 
 Demonstrates the sending data from the computer to the Arduino board,
 in this case to control the brightness of an LED.  The data is sent
 in individual bytes, each of which ranges from 0 to 255.  Arduino
 reads these bytes and uses them to set the brightness of the LED.
 
 The circuit:
 LED attached from digital pin 13 to ground.
 Serial connection to Processing, Max/MSP, or another serial application

    brightness = Serial.read();
    // set the brightness of the LED:
